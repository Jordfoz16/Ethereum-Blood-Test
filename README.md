# Abstract
The report aims to discover if blockchain could be used to improve the sharing of EHR (Electronic Health Records) amongst medical institutions, while also providing more control and access for patients over their own data. Current literature and artefacts on medical records stored on the blockchain were reviewed during the report, with a focus on projects using open sourced blockchains. The report looks into the time it takes to propagate EHR across the network, and also the reliability of uploading a larger amount of data to the blockchain. The conclusion of the report is that blockchain could be a viable solution to improving sharing of EHR, while also providing more control for patients over their own health records. The report finds that the data distribution time for an EHR is much lower than the current system, giving patients access to their data within minutes of its creation. The report also shows that block time and transactions per second wasn’t a limitation in these tests, but it could be the limiting factor if the platform needed to scale to a globe scale. With some more developments in the field, blockchain could be a solution for the storage of the EHR’s.
